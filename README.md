# Capstone_Project

- *Project Topic*

The relation between good and bad lifestyle choices as it relates to the incidence and outcome of cancer

- *Reasons why we selected this topic*

There are a lot of different types of cancers and there's a lot of data being generated for this. It will be interesting to see if there are any factors that are associated with higher cancer incidence

## Data Source

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rishidamarla/cancer-patients-data
- We are using a cleaned verison of “Cancer Patients Data” which is an excel file gathered from Kaggle. This file contains hundreds of lung cancer patients data about their lifestyles. We converted this excel file to a csv and removed columns that we felt would not be useful. Leaving us with the columns shown here.

-   We also renamed the labels for the “Cancer Severity” column; replacing “Low,” “Medium,” and “High” with “1,  2 and 3” respectively. This step was completed in order to prevent any ValueErrors that we may receive while completing our analysis.

## Data Exploration


## Data Analysis 


Here are a few preliminary questions:
1. Is there any lifestyle choice that is connected to higher incidence of cancer
2. Is there any lifestyle choice associated with more severe outcomes of cancer
3. Are there multiple lifestyle factors that are associated higher incidence

## Project Outline
1. Find and clean data
2. Analyze data to determine which ML model will work best for our dataset 
3. Run various models using Supervised Machiene Learning techiniques.
4. Create ERD with relationships for database.
5. Create database in PGAdmin.
6. Determine how the database will interact with the model.
7. Create tables, join and connection string bewteen database and the model.
8. Create the blueprint for the dashboard and add storyboard to Google Slides. - Creating two databases
9. Evaluate what tools will be used to create dashboard.
10. Create vizualizations for dashboard.
11. Disucss results of analysis- what are the top 3 symtoms for each level of cancer severity?
12. Analyze what could have been done better for optimum results.


## Communication Protocols

Individual slack group to message and keep in touch, planning in google docs, and zoom calls to track group progress. We have been meeting Mondays and Wednesdays for 30 minutes before class time to connect and discuss indivdual updates that we would like to share with the team.


## Machine Learning Model

*Preliminary Data Preprocessing*

*Preliminary Feature Engineering/Selection*

*Splitting Data into training and testing sets*

*Model Choice Explanation- include limitations and benefits*

*Explanation of any changes that were made to the model*

*Description of how the model was trained*

*Description and explanation of model's confusion matrix-include final accuracy score*

## Dashboard 
*Include link to dash or a video of dash demo*

*Tools Used to Build and Run the Dashboard are as follows*
- Javascript (d3.json)
- Bootstrap components
- HTML
- Visual Studio Code
- Pandas

*Interactive Elements*
- User will be able to input patient ID to see symptom scores and lifestyle choices as a bar graph

## Database 

*Description of interface with the project*
*Description of two tables used*
*Description of join/s*
*Description of connection string*


## Results 

## Reccomendations for Future Analysis
*include anything that we would have done differently*
