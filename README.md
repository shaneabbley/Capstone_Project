- *Selected Topic*

The relation between good and bad lifestyle choices as it relates to the incidence and outcome of cancer

- *Reasons why we selected this topic*

There are a lot of different types of cancers and there's a lot of data being generated for this. It will be interesting to see if there are any factors that are associated with higher cancer incidence

- *Description of the source of data*

The data is part of cleaned, encoded dataset from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rishidamarla/cancer-patients-data?resource=download) which pulls from this [source](https://data.world/cancerdatahp/lung-cancer-data/workspace/file?filename=cancer+patient+level%20data+sets.xlsx) 


- *Questions we hope to answer with this data*

Here are a few preliminary questions:
1. Is there any lifestyle choice that is connected to higher incidence of cancer
2. Is there any lifestyle choice associated with more severe outcomes of cancer
3. Are there multiple lifestyle factors that are associated higher incidence
