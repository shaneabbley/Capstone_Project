# Capstone_Project

- *Project Topic*

The relation between good and bad lifestyle choices as it relates to the incidence and outcome of cancer

- *Reasons why we selected this topic*

There are a lot of different types of cancers and there's a lot of data being generated for this. It will be interesting to see if there are any factors that are associated with higher cancer incidence

## Data Exploration 

- *Description of the source of data*

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rishidamarla/cancer-patients-data
- We are using a cleaned verison of “Cancer Patients Data” which is an excel file gathered from Kaggle. This file contains hundreds of lung cancer patients data about their lifestyles. We converted this excel file to a csv and removed columns that we felt would not be useful. Leaving us with the columns shown here.

-   We also renamed the labels for the “Cancer Severity” column; replacing “Low,” “Medium,” and “High” with “1,  2 and 3” respectively. This step was completed in order to prevent any ValueErrors that we may receive while completing our analysis.


## Data Analysis 


Here are a few preliminary questions:
1. Is there any lifestyle choice that is connected to higher incidence of cancer
2. Is there any lifestyle choice associated with more severe outcomes of cancer
3. Are there multiple lifestyle factors that are associated higher incidence

## Project Outline

## Communication Protocols

Individual slack group to message and keep in touch, planning in google docs, and zoom calls to track group progress. We have been meeting Mondays and Wednesdays for 30 minutes before class time to connect and discuss indivdual updates that we would like to share with the team.
